# Experiments with Python
Getting started on Python to now start learning and getting experience with machine learning, data analysis, and development of artificial intelligence

## It's time to test if I have a working environment to run a Python file 
First project will be running a simple Python file that prints "Hello, World!". Albeit simple, it proves that I have the necessary tools installed to sufficiently run any Python file I want, which means I can develop way more impressive projects with Python now. 

## Ambitious Goals
* Learn and experiment with Machine Learning strategies 
* Similar to my Functional Button Testing repository where I experiment with various user input design with CSS and functionality with JavaScript, I will also showcase all the Machine Learning techniques and other notable Python concepts I have learn into discrete, individual experiments within their respective folders!
